# Home Lab Notes

This repository documents my journey in building and configuring a virtual home lab to develop IT support and cybersecurity skills. It is my hope that by challenging my skillset and demonstrating my ability to overcome potential problems, I will increase my chances at getting into an entry level position to develop my carrer. Additionally, I aim to familiarize myself with common technologies used in the industry. 

## Lab Overview
- **Windows Server 2019**: Active Directory, DNS, DHCP
- **Windows 10 Client**: Domain join, Group Policy
- **Ubuntu Server**: Syslog server, Linux administration

## Goals
- Gain practical experience with IT infrastructure
- Improve troubleshooting and documentation skills
- Share learning process publicly
